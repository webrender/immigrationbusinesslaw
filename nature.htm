<hr>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Primarily this office handles business immigration legal matters with the primary goal of assisting corporations and/or individuals in obtaining either temporary, nonimmigrant visas and/or Permanent Resident Immigrant Visas.

	<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In particular, on a daily basis, owing to representation of quality pharmaceutical and biotechnological entities, typically Petitions are prepared to apply for such temporary classifications as: H-lB Professional Occupations; O-1 Extraordinary Ability aliens, such as in the Sciences; and L-1 Intracompany Transferees.

	<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Furthermore, this office has considerable expertise in representation of a biotechnological research institute which is an approved and authorized Sponsor of an Exchange Visitors Program and, therefore, is extremely familiar with the scope and dimensions of the J-l Exchange Visitor category.

	<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Owing to the fact that many of the aliens for whom business immigration counsel is sought by the pharmaceutical/ biotechnological corporate clients of this office, for long-term Permanent Resident considerations, there is a high degree of frequency in preparing the following:

	<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1.  Employment-Based Preference Petitions, such as: Extraordinary Ability, International Manager/Executive, Outstanding Researcher, National Interest Waiver; and

	<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 2.  Customary and traditional Labor Certification Applications.

	<br><br>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Unequivocably, since this office repeatedly handles matters pertaining to the Biological Sciences, such as Molecular and Cellular Biology, Biophysics, Biomedical Research, and also Computer Science, it results in the ability to be able to interpret and explain clearly to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. Department of State, in conjunction with Visa Application matters, the practical impact, qualifications and benefit of research undertakings in the above disciplines.
